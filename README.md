Personal website. Coded using create-react app and eventually ejected to support CSS modules.

Uses:
* React.Js
* SASS
* CSS Modules
* AirBnB Eslint
* SemanticUI
* Velocity.js
* react-slick

Website is outdated and taken down.
Visible through WayBackMachine but it is missing a lot of content: https://web.archive.org/web/20191028185754/http://www.colegottdank.com/
New personal website is in progress however not a priority as I shifted to a backend developer.
